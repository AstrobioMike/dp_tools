  Study Description: RR-1 is a validation flight to evaluate the hardware, operational
    and science capabilities of the Rodent Research Project on the ISS. RNA, DNA,
    and protein were purified from liver tissues from RR-1 mice (female, C57BL/6J,
    16wk old at time of launch). From each group, two liver samples were collected
    and frozen immediately after euthanasia. The rest of the liver samples from each
    group were collected from frozen carcasses dissected post-flight. RNA-Seq, whole
    genome and RNA BS-Seq (bisulfite sequencing) and proteomic expression profiling
    were performed. RNA extracted from these tissues was re-sequenced; these data
    are available as part of GLDS-168 (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-168).

    Study Protocol Description: 'Samples were processed at the Stanford University
      Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility in two batches, the first batch
      included spaceflight and ground control samples and the second batch included
      basal and vivarium control samples.  In the first batch, the samples were divided
      into two TMT 10-plex labeling groups. Group B consisted of ground control (GC)
      samples 21, 22, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, a pool of all NASA GC samples, a pool of
      all NASA and CASIS (GLDS-47) GC samples, and a pool of all CASIS (GLDS-47) basal
      (BA) samples. Group C consisted of spaceflight (FLT) samples 2, 3, 25, 26, 27,
      28, 30, a pool of all NASA FLT samples, a pool of all NASA and CASIS (GLDS-47)
      FLT samples, and a pool of all CASIS (GLDS-47) basal (BA) samples. This labeling
      scheme enables comparison across NASA and CASIS specimen groups in the RR-1
      study. CASIS FLT and GC samples were labeled separately as TMT 10-plex Group
      A (GLDS-47).  In the second batch, the ten basal and vivarium control samples
      were processed in one TMT 11-plex labeling group along with one pool of all
      samples. TMT Isobaric label reagent lot number RE231321 (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/90110)  SUMS
      protocol was followed: 50 ug were drawn from each samples defrosted on ice.
      The remaining sample was immediately placed back in -80C. 25uL of 50mM ammonium
      bicarbonate, pH 8.0 was added to each sample, followed by 1.5 uL of 500mM DTT,
      incubated at 50C for 30 minutes and cooled to room temperature. 3 uL of 1M propionamide
      was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 1hr. 75 uL of
      50mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.02% protease max was added to each sample followed
      by 1.5 ug of trypsin/lysC (Promega) and overnight incubation at 37C.  10 uL
      of 10% formic acid, 90% water was added to each sample to quench the digest.
      The samples were incubated at 37C for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation
      at 10,000g for 5 minutes. Microspin C18 columns (NEST group, p/n SEM SS18V)
      were equilibrated with acetonitrile followed by 2 times wash with 0.1% formic
      acid/water and each sample was cleaned and concentrated independently per vendor
      protocol. The eluant peptides were dried in a speed vac to <2 uL volume and
      stored at 4C prior to TMT isobaric labeling. Each peptide pool was reconstituted
      in 100 uL, 100mM HEPES, pH 8.0. The TMT isobaric labels were reconstituted in
      40 uL absolute ethyl alcohol and 20 uL of each isobaric tag as described above
      was added to the corresponding sample. The samples incubated at room temperature
      for 1.5hr, followed by the addition of 5 uL hydroxylamine to quench the reaction.
      50 uL of each isobaric-tagged peptide pool was drawn and pooled to a final volume
      of 500 uL, 500 uL of 0.1% formic acid water was added to a final volume of 1mL.
      This fraction (~250 ug total peptide) was purified on a Water Oasis HLB 3cc
      C18 cartridge per vendor protocol and the final eluent dried to completion in
      a speed vac. SCX offline fractionation was performed using a Protea SCX column
      (p/n SP-155) and the provided buffers. In brief, the previously dried 10plex
      peptide pool was dissolved in 150 uL reconstitution solution and loaded onto
      the equilibrated SCX column (3 times) followed by 2 sequential washes. The elution
      solution provided in the kit was diluted in series to 50mM, 100mM, 150mM, 200mM,
      300mM and 400mM (stock) concentrations. The peptides were then eluted starting
      with the 50mM salt concentration and collected in a new tube for the entire
      series. 200 uL of 0.1% formic acid water was added to each SCX eluted fraction
      and each was Microspin C18 purified as previously described. Each fraction was
      reconstituted in 20 uL 0.2% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile, 97.8% water and injected
      for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. '

    Study Protocol Description: 'The flight group mice were euthanized by ISS crew
      with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation. Liver was collected
      after spleen upon euthanasia for mice M21 and M22, and was frozen in a pre-chilled
      Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C). For the rest
      of the spaceflight mice, the carcasses were frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold
      Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth
      where disscetion was held. Ground control mice M31 and M32 followed the same
      protocol of on-orbit dissected animals (M21 and M22) and the livers were collected
      immediately followed by euthanasia. Rest of the ground control animals and all
      the basal and vivarium animals in this dataset have been dissected postflight
      per the protocol in the following.  Postflight dissection protocol: Mouse carcasses
      were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes.
      Multiple tissues, including liver, were collected from each carcass. Total dissection
      time for each carcass was no longer than 30 minutes since collection of the
      first tissue.  Liver was preserved in RLT buffer or protein lysis buffer, homogenized
      and snap frozen with liquid nitrogren.'

    Study Protocol Description: RNA and DNA were extracted usign the AllPrep DNA/RNA
      Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, homogenization buffer for DNA and
      RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 volumes beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer
      RLT (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of
      tissue was isolated using a scalpel and immediately placed in 800 uL of the
      Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds
      at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard
      dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged
      for 3 minutes at room temperature at 15,000 RPM to remove cell debris. The supernatant
      from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the
      manufacturer's protocol. RNA was eluted twice per sample in 30 uL H2O per elution.
      Concentration and absorbance ratios for all RNA and DNA samples were measured
      using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
      MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent
      RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa
      Clara, CA).

    Study Protocol Description: For protein homogenization the urea based protein
      lysis buffer consisted of 8 M urea, with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, at pH 8.5
      in DNase- and RNase-free H2O and was custom ordered from Teknova, Hollister,
      CA. This recipe was initially provided by Stanford University Mass Spectrometry
      (SUMS). Protease inhibitors, 1:100 volumes of 0.1 M phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride
      solution in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) and 1:100 volumes of
      cOmplete EDTA-free tablets (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), were added to the lysis
      buffer kept on ice. A piece of liver weighing between 20-30 mg was cut from
      each liver sample and immediately added to 650 uL protein lysis buffer. Each
      sample was homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron
      PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica,
      Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4 C and at 14,000
      X g to remove cell debris. A 30 uL sample of each supernatant was kept on ice
      for total protein concentration assay, and the rest of the supernatant was snap-frozen
      with liquid nitrogen in aliquots. The Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher
      Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to measure the total protein concentration
      of each protein sample.
