  Study Protocol Description: 'A cohort of 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson
    Lab) were flown to the ISS, housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subject to microgravity
    for 37 days. Mice of simiar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls
    housed in the identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Additionally,
    mice from the same cohort were used as basal control and vivarium control. Basal
    control mice were euthanized the day after launch as baseline references. Vivarium
    mice were housed in the standard vivarium cages for the same amount of time as
    spaceflight and ground control animals. '

  Study Protocol Description: 'The flight group mice were euthanized by ISS crew with
    Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation. Liver was collected after
    spleen upon euthanasia for mice M21 and M22, and was frozen in a pre-chilled Mini
    Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C). For the rest of the
    spaceflight mice, the carcasses were frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB)
    before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth where disscetion
    was held. Ground control mice M31 and M32 followed the same protocol of on-orbit
    dissected animals (M21 and M22) and the livers were collected immediately followed
    by euthanasia. Rest of the ground control animals and all the basal and vivarium
    animals in this dataset have been dissected postflight per the protocol in the
    following.  Postflight dissection protocol: Mouse carcasses were removed from
    -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes. Multiple tissues,
    including liver, were collected from each carcass. Total dissection time for each
    carcass was no longer than 30 minutes since collection of the first tissue.  Liver
    was preserved in RLT buffer or protein lysis buffer, homogenized and snap frozen
    with liquid nitrogren.'

  Study Protocol Description: RNA and DNA were extracted usign the AllPrep DNA/RNA
    Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, homogenization buffer for DNA and RNA
    purification was made by adding 1:100 volumes beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT
    (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of tissue
    was isolated using a scalpel and immediately placed in 800 uL of the Buffer RLT
    solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000
    RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing
    aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes
    at room temperature at 15,000 RPM to remove cell debris. The supernatant from
    each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer's
    protocol. RNA was eluted twice per sample in 30 uL H2O per elution. Concentration
    and absorbance ratios for all RNA and DNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop
    2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was
    assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit
    or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).

  Study Protocol Description: For protein homogenization the urea based protein lysis
    buffer consisted of 8 M urea, with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, at pH 8.5 in DNase-
    and RNase-free H2O and was custom ordered from Teknova, Hollister, CA. This recipe
    was initially provided by Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS). Protease
    inhibitors, 1:100 volumes of 0.1 M phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride solution in
    ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) and 1:100 volumes of cOmplete EDTA-free
    tablets (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), were added to the lysis buffer kept on ice.
    A piece of liver weighing between 20-30 mg was cut from each liver sample and
    immediately added to 650 uL protein lysis buffer. Each sample was homogenized
    for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer
    with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates
    were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4 C and at 14,000 X g to remove cell debris.
    A 30 uL sample of each supernatant was kept on ice for total protein concentration
    assay, and the rest of the supernatant was snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen in
    aliquots. The Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
    MA) was used to measure the total protein concentration of each protein sample.

  Study Protocol Description: 'Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass
    Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility in two batches, the first batch included
    spaceflight and ground control samples and the second batch included basal and
    vivarium control samples.  In the first batch, the samples were divided into two
    TMT 10-plex labeling groups. Group B consisted of ground control (GC) samples
    21, 22, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, a pool of all NASA GC samples, a pool of all NASA
    and CASIS (GLDS-47) GC samples, and a pool of all CASIS (GLDS-47) basal (BA) samples.
    Group C consisted of spaceflight (FLT) samples 2, 3, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, a pool
    of all NASA FLT samples, a pool of all NASA and CASIS (GLDS-47) FLT samples, and
    a pool of all CASIS (GLDS-47) basal (BA) samples. This labeling scheme enables
    comparison across NASA and CASIS specimen groups in the RR-1 study. CASIS FLT
    and GC samples were labeled separately as TMT 10-plex Group A (GLDS-47).  In the
    second batch, the ten basal and vivarium control samples were processed in one
    TMT 11-plex labeling group along with one pool of all samples. TMT Isobaric label
    reagent lot number RE231321 (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/90110)  SUMS
    protocol was followed: 50 ug were drawn from each samples defrosted on ice. The
    remaining sample was immediately placed back in -80C. 25uL of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate,
    pH 8.0 was added to each sample, followed by 1.5 uL of 500mM DTT, incubated at
    50C for 30 minutes and cooled to room temperature. 3 uL of 1M propionamide was
    added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 1hr. 75 uL of 50mM
    ammonium bicarbonate, 0.02% protease max was added to each sample followed by
    1.5 ug of trypsin/lysC (Promega) and overnight incubation at 37C.  10 uL of 10%
    formic acid, 90% water was added to each sample to quench the digest. The samples
    were incubated at 37C for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 10,000g for
    5 minutes. Microspin C18 columns (NEST group, p/n SEM SS18V) were equilibrated
    with acetonitrile followed by 2 times wash with 0.1% formic acid/water and each
    sample was cleaned and concentrated independently per vendor protocol. The eluant
    peptides were dried in a speed vac to <2 uL volume and stored at 4C prior to TMT
    isobaric labeling. Each peptide pool was reconstituted in 100 uL, 100mM HEPES,
    pH 8.0. The TMT isobaric labels were reconstituted in 40 uL absolute ethyl alcohol
    and 20 uL of each isobaric tag as described above was added to the corresponding
    sample. The samples incubated at room temperature for 1.5hr, followed by the addition
    of 5 uL hydroxylamine to quench the reaction. 50 uL of each isobaric-tagged peptide
    pool was drawn and pooled to a final volume of 500 uL, 500 uL of 0.1% formic acid
    water was added to a final volume of 1mL. This fraction (~250 ug total peptide)
    was purified on a Water Oasis HLB 3cc C18 cartridge per vendor protocol and the
    final eluent dried to completion in a speed vac. SCX offline fractionation was
    performed using a Protea SCX column (p/n SP-155) and the provided buffers. In
    brief, the previously dried 10plex peptide pool was dissolved in 150 uL reconstitution
    solution and loaded onto the equilibrated SCX column (3 times) followed by 2 sequential
    washes. The elution solution provided in the kit was diluted in series to 50mM,
    100mM, 150mM, 200mM, 300mM and 400mM (stock) concentrations. The peptides were
    then eluted starting with the 50mM salt concentration and collected in a new tube
    for the entire series. 200 uL of 0.1% formic acid water was added to each SCX
    eluted fraction and each was Microspin C18 purified as previously described. Each
    fraction was reconstituted in 20 uL 0.2% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile, 97.8% water
    and injected for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. '
